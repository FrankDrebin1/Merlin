# Merlin
Merlin is a program that aims to use machine learning and multiple levels of input to guess roles in the card game Avalon.
The original version of the program is written in Java and utilizes Swing for the GUI, however it is not very effective at guessing roles and has an accuracy rate of around 30%. The improved version of the program is built in Java and will aim to use machine learning.


The old java files for the initial program are included for reference.
